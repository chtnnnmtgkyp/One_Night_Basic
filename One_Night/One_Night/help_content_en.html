<p><strong><span style="font-size:15.0pt">Using the App</span></strong><br />
You'll need the original <em>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</em> game, the <em>One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak</em> game, or the <em>One Night Ultimate Vampire</em> game in order to use this app.</p>
<p>Choose the combination of games you're playing with along the top of the main screen. Selected (active) games will have a white frame around them; only the roles from selected games will be available for selection. Roles are automatically sorted in the order they wake up at night, with non-waking roles at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>Choose the roles you're using in the game by tapping them on the main screen. Selected (active) roles will have a white frame around them; only selected roles will be called during the night phase.</p>
<p>Tap the Game Timer button to turn it on and off. It is on when a white frame is displayed around it. If on, the Game Timer will start right after the night phase is over (when the announcer says "Everyone, Wake up!"). If the Game Timer is off, the app will return to the main role selection screen after the night phase is over.</p>
<p>Tap the Play button when you're ready for the night phase to begin (after everyone has their role cards, has viewed them, and has placed them back in the center of the table). The number shown to the right of the Play button indicates how many roles have been selected (you may not be able to see all selected roles on the screen at once).</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:15.0pt">Customizing Settings</span></strong><br />
Tap the gear icon in the lower right corner to view the settings screen. The settings screen allows you to customize every aspect of the One Night Ultimate Werewolf app.</p>
<p>On the Settings screen, tapping the Back button returns you to the main screen. Tapping the Help button displays this Help that you're reading now. Tapping the Bezier Games logo takes you to the Bezier Games website.</p>
<p><strong>Narration Settings</strong><br />
The Narration Settings allows you to change the voice as well as the volume of the narration.</p>
<p><strong>Background Settings</strong><br />
The Background Settings allows you to change the background sounds/music and its volume. These background sounds are played during the night phase (to help cover up any sounds made by players as they interact with the cards).</p>
<p><strong>Game Timer Settings</strong><br />
On this screen you can turn the 1 minute and 30 second warnings on and off, and also change the length of the game timer.</p>
<p><strong>Role Timer Settings</strong><br />
This timer determines the length of the pause during each role's action. Double the length of the pause for complex roles: Doppelganger, Cupid, Priest, Marksman, Squire, and Beholder with the 2X COMPLEX ROLES option.</p>
<p><strong>Other Options</strong><br />
This screen allows you to turn on and off the following:</p>
<p>Lone Wolf: This common option tells the werewolves that if there is a single werewolf, he may look at one of the center cards.</p>
<p>Labels: This turns the text labels on and off on the Role Selection Screen.</p>
<p>Move Your Card: This turns the "Move your cards around slightly" screen on and off during the nighttime narration.</p>
<p>Expert Mode: This shortens the narration to speak only the most critical commands, and makes the night go much faster.</p>
<p>Verbose Doppelganger: This lists all the roles that do their night action immediately when the Doppelganger initially wakes up.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:15.0pt">Tips</span></strong><br />
You don't need to explain roles to new players; the descriptions are in the role call outs in the app and can be learned "live." Refer to the game rules for detailed information on how each of the roles work.</p>
<p>The game timer should be set to 1 minute less than the number of players that are playing, or less, for the best game experience.</p>
<p>Tap and hold the Game Timer button to go directly to the Game Timer Settings screen.</p>
<p>Tapping the Vote Now button while the Game Timer is running will skip immediately to the "time is up...everyone 3 2 1 vote" audio.</p>
<p>The Role Timer time can be decreased as you become familiar with the game. "Experts" can turn off the Role Timer or set the time to 0 seconds.</p>
<p>The Village Idiot *always* has 5 extra seconds when he is called in order to complete his task (even if the Role Timer is 0 seconds, the Village Idiot will have 5 seconds to complete his action).</p>
<p>When the app is active on any screen, it prevents your device from going to sleep. If playing for extended periods of time, you should plug in your device or change the brightness to a low setting.</p>
<p>Notifications (calls, mail, messages, etc.) may interrupt the playback of the app, depending on how your notifications (iOS) are set up.</p>
